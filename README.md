ðŸ‘‹ Hello peeps!

I got tired of always creating this application layout time and time again ðŸ˜…
So decided to just create a template that's easily used for starting new python projects and throw it up here on Github.

Quick explaination of folder structure:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ examples # http request examples for trying the application out
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers # providers routes and handles incoming/outgoing requests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dtos # Transfer Objects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models # Implements core business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pkg # Common modules available for usage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories # Each repository would implement some type of "outside connection", could be database, could be sqs for example.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database # Contains interface definition for database and database implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services # Service lives between controllers and repository, uses repositories to call "outside connection" without knowing anything about the implementation of that connection.
â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ services # examples of how unit tests would be implemented
```

This project is loosly based on [Uncle bobs clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) but doesn't use is-a relationships via inheritance, instead by using @abc.abstractclassmethod we simulate something very similar to interface implementation in other languages, such as Go or Java :) This is the cleanest way I've found to implement is-a relationship without getting into a inheritance hell. ðŸ‘¿
